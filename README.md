# Acme Financial Dashboard
Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Supabase** — a modern, performant financial dashboard engineered for speed and scalability.

**Acme Financial Dashboard** is inspired by the official [Next.js Learn Course](https://nextjs.org/learn) financial dashboard, but this version was **rebuilt from scratch** (no course code used).  
The focus is clean architecture, **real-world data flows**, and **noticeable performance improvements** over the reference app.
